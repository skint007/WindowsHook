    <description>
		This library attaches to windows global hooks, tracks keyboard and mouse clicks and movement,please note this don't support common .Net events with KeyEventArgs and MouseEventArgs. this is the difference with MouseKeyHook project. But you can still easily retrieve any information you need:
		* Mouse coordinates
		* Mouse buttons clicked
		* Mouse drag actions
		* Mouse wheel scrolls
		* Key presses and releases
		* Special key states

		Additionally, there are `MouseEventExtArgs` and `KeyEventExtArgs` which provide further options:
		* Input suppression
		* Timestamp
		* IsMouseDown/Up
		* IsKeyDown/Up.

		Additionally, there is a possibility to supress certain keyboard or mouse clicks, or detect special key combinations.
		Based on [WindowsHook](https://github.com/topstarai/WindowsHook) by topstarai. Added injected flag detection to both mouse events and keyboard events. This is useful if for example you want to preform continuous mouse clicks of the same type of the currently held down mouse button. Supports .Net 4.8,.Net 6+, WinForm, WPF etc.
